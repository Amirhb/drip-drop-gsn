# DripDrop GSN
DripDrop GSN is a Solidity project that allows anyone to create a testnet token and faucet for it. This can be useful for dApp development, as it allows developers to test their applications without having to spend real money on gas fees.

This version supports [GSN](https://opengsn.org/).
